# LeRobot Dataset Visualizer

LeRobot Dataset Visualizer is a web application for interactive exploration and visualization of robotics datasets, particularly those in the LeRobot format. It enables users to browse, view, and analyze episodes from large-scale robotics datasets, combining synchronized video playback with rich, interactive data graphs.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to help robotics researchers and practitioners quickly inspect and understand large, complex datasets. It fetches dataset metadata and episode data (including video and sensor/telemetry data), and provides a unified interface for:

- Navigating between organizations, datasets, and episodes
- Watching episode videos
- Exploring synchronized time-series data with interactive charts
- Paginating through large datasets efficiently

## Key Features

- **Dataset & Episode Navigation:** Quickly jump between organizations, datasets, and episodes using a sidebar and navigation controls.
- **Synchronized Video & Data:** Video playback is synchronized with interactive data graphs for detailed inspection of sensor and control signals.
- **Efficient Data Loading:** Uses parquet and JSON loading for large dataset support, with pagination and chunking.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for a fast, modern user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React**
- **Recharts** (for data visualization)
- **hyparquet** (for reading Parquet files)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx` or other files in the `src/` directory. The app supports hot-reloading for rapid development.

### Environment Variables

- `DATASET_URL`: (optional) Base URL for dataset hosting (defaults to HuggingFace Datasets).
